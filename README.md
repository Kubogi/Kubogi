## Ciallo ～(∠・ω< )⌒☆

- I'm a first-year Computer Science student who builds things sometimes.
- I've been getting into full-stack projects, figuring out how to make them actually work, and learning the practical side of coding along the way.
- I also enjoy competitive programming and have participated in various competitions, which taught me problem-solving skills and how to think algorithmically.
